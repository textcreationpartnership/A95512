         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A Little help will ſave this Kingdom, neglect will hazard the loſſe of it; the ruine of which will be a fearfull Alarum to both the other. Sir <hi>William Gilburt</hi> Governour of the Fort of <hi>Mariborough</hi> in the Queens County, in the Province of <hi>Leimſter,</hi> had before the Ceſſation three compleat Companies of Foot, and a Troope of good Horſe, with which he did not only ſecure his own. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, but preſerved the Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Caſtle low.</hi> and his Forces in the Caſtle of <hi>Athlon,</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Conaught</hi> upon the borders of <hi>Leimſter,</hi> a Proteſtant Gariſon ſome ten miles, or more from him; but the Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation being agreed, two of thoſe three Companies, and the Troop of horſe were called off by the Marqueſſe of <hi>Ormoud,</hi> and not only the Caſtle of <hi>Athlone</hi> was (by this meanes left naked) but <hi>Mariborough</hi> Fort in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Sir <hi>William Gilburt</hi> having only one Company left to keep the Garriſon, and the Lord <hi>Dillon</hi> not 100. men in <hi>Athlone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:113853:3"/>
Sir <hi>William Gilburt</hi> therefore ſent up his eldeſt Son, his Deputie-Governour, and a Gentleman that hath done good ſervice againſt the Rebels, to the Parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, whoſe diſpatch for employments hath been much wiſhed for by us.</p>
            <p>Supplies ſo much, and ſo long deſired, not coming, makes the old Iriſh to inſult the more, though one rout would (I verily believe) turn the skales.</p>
            <p>But a Peace being concluded between the ſupreame Councell, and the Marqueſſe of <hi>Ormond,</hi> it puts us into a far worſe condition: Ormond and Digby with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are got fafe to Dublin, and there they are fortifying, and mending their Workes from the Colledge to St. Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, and Newſtreet, and ſo to St. Iames Gate, and ſince their return from Kilkennie the Guards have been ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger about the City; For the Marqueſſe of Ormond and the Lord Digby are in ſome feare of the Rebels that are riſen againſt the peace concluded.</p>
            <p>The Rebels miſſing their deſign of murdering the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of Ormond, and Digby, with them in Kilkennie, as was plotted, they with their Forces marched into the Queens Countie in Leimſter, within 20 miles of Kilken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and there took the Fort of Mairborough by ſurprize, notwithſtanding the Peace concluded, Sir William Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burt, with all the Officers and Souldiers, Miniſters, and Inhabitants, to the number of 1000. men, women, and children of the Town that are Proteſtants, all being at the mercy of the Rebels.</p>
            <p>And the Caſtle of Athlone in Conaught was alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them in the like manner. The Lord Dillon and all his Officers and Souldiers were ſurpriſed, and are at the mercy of thoſe bloudy Rebels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:113853:3"/>
Theſe Forces of the Iriſh (in number almoſt 1000. and all armed) are within little now then twenty miles of Dublin.</p>
            <p>Theſe two places which they have taken, the loſſe of them is great, Athlone ſtands upon the River ſide juſt upon the mouth of Lough Ree, towards Caſtle-More, and Mariborough Fort is in the hart of Leimſter.</p>
